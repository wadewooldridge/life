# Life
## Overview
This Life game is an implementation of the John Horton Conway cellular
automaton rules developed in the 1970's.  This implementation was done as
a JavaScript programming exercise for Learning Fuze.  It uses a basic HTML
page with CSS formatting and a Bootstrap grid layout, using JavaScript
code for the client-side calculations.
